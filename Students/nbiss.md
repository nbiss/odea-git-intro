## About Me
The most interesting thing I've learned this year is....

The most tinteresting thing that I have leaded this year is JavaScript. It's quite intersesting and different from the python that I was coding with. 
I did not think that I was going to learn it but it is very fun and cool.
Another interesting thing I've learnded about this year was linked lists. Using nodes as a structure for data with a pointer to the next node. Allowing the data to be a flow of structures making them easy to use and understand.
Okay im adding more stuff so I can see this work.
